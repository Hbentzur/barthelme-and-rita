## Barthelme & RiTa.js (and a little bit of Daniil Kharms)

- Blue Notebook no.10 0.0.1: You want his reality, get it? In fact, let's not talk about that anymore.

- Blue Notebook no.10: Cortés and Montezuma is denounced as contrary to the best interests of the people of Mexico, born and yet unborn. Cortés and Montezuma are walking, down by the docks. In fact, let's not talk about that anymore.

- Blue Notebook no.10 0.0.2: She hugged Rebecca, on the sofa. In fact, let's not talk about that anymore.

### The process
I used puppeteer to scrape Donald Barthelme texts, and some array & JSON manipulations to clean the data. I was surprised at how easy it was to manipulate the text using RiTa – and dropped it into Tracery to generate a paragraph using Daniil Kharms 'Blue Notebook no.10' opening and ending sentences to frame it. I'm not sure that's the most interesting thing I've created – but it was interesting to see how flexible text can be (+ I learned a lot).
